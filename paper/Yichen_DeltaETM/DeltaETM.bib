              that $\alpha$- and $\beta$-cells from children exhibit less

              $\alpha$- and $\beta$-cells from donors with type 2 diabetes have

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus is characterized by loss or
              dysfunction of insulin-producing $\beta$-cells in the pancreas,
              resulting in failure of blood glucose regulation and devastating
              secondary complications. Thus, $\beta$-cells are currently the
              prime target for cell-replacement and regenerative therapy.
              Triggering endogenous repair is a promising strategy to restore
              $\beta$-cell mass and normoglycemia in diabetic patients.
              Potential strategies include targeting specific $\beta$-cell
              subpopulations to increase proliferation or maturation.
              Alternatively, transdifferentiation of pancreatic islet cells
              (e.g. $\alpha$- or $\delta$-cells), extra-islet cells (acinar and
              ductal cells), hepatocytes, or intestinal cells into
              insulin-producing cells might improve glycemic control. To this
              end, it is crucial to systematically characterize and unravel the
              transcriptional program of all pancreatic cell types at the
              molecular level in homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, it is
              necessary to better determine the underlying mechanisms of
              $\beta$-cell maturation, maintenance, and dysfunction in
              diabetes, to identify and molecularly profile endocrine
              subpopulations with regenerative potential, and to translate the
              findings from mice to man. Recent approaches in single-cell
              biology started to illuminate heterogeneity and plasticity in the
              pancreas that might be targeted for $\beta$-cell regeneration in
              diabetic patients. SCOPE OF REVIEW: This review discusses recent
              literature on single-cell analysis including single-cell RNA
              sequencing, single-cell mass cytometry, and flow cytometry of
              pancreatic cell types in the context of mechanisms of endogenous
              $\beta$-cell regeneration. We discuss new findings on the
              regulation of postnatal $\beta$-cell proliferation and
              maturation. We highlight how single-cell analysis recapitulates
              described principles of functional $\beta$-cell heterogeneity in
              animal models and adds new knowledge on the extent of
              $\beta$-cell heterogeneity in humans as well as its role in
              homeostasis and disease. Furthermore, we summarize the findings
              on cell subpopulations with regenerative potential that might
              enable the formation of new $\beta$-cells in diseased state.
              Finally, we review new data on the transcriptional program and
              function of rare pancreatic cell types and their implication in
              diabetes. MAJOR CONCLUSION: Novel, single-cell technologies offer
              high molecular resolution of cellular heterogeneity within the
              pancreas and provide information on processes and factors that
              govern $\beta$-cell homeostasis, proliferation, and maturation.
              Eventually, these technologies might lead to the characterization
              of cells with regenerative potential and unravel
              disease-associated changes in gene expression to identify
              cellular and molecular targets for therapy.",

              associated with peripheral insulin resistance. However, despite
              decades of research, the pathogenic mechanisms underlying T2D
              remain poorly defined. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) enables
              multiplexed assessment of the abundance and subcellular
              localization of multiple proteins on the same tissue section.
              Herein, we utilized IMC with a panel of 34 antibodies to quantify
              key markers of pancreatic exocrine, islet, and immune cells as
              well as stromal components. We employed this panel to analyze
              over 2.1 million cells from 16 pancreata obtained from donors
              with T2D and 13 pancreata from age similar non-diabetic controls.
              In the T2D pancreata, we observed significant alterations in
              islet architecture, endocrine cell composition, and surprisingly
              immune cell constituents. Thus, both HLA-DR positive CD8 T cells

              aggressive among all gastrointestinal tumors. The complex
              intra-tumor heterogeneity and special tumor microenvironment in
              PDAC bring great challenges for developing effective treatment
              strategies. We aimed to delineate dynamic changes of tumor
              microenvironment components during PDAC malignant progression
              utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing. METHODS: A total of 11
              samples (4 PDAC I, 4 PDAC II, 3 PDAC III) were used to construct
              expression matrix. After identifying distinct cell clusters,
              subcluster analysis for each cluster was performed. New cancer
              associated fibroblasts (CAFs) subset was validated by weighted
              gene co-expression network analysis, RNA in situ hybridization
              and immunofluorescence. FINDINGS: We found that ductal cells were
              not dominant component while tumor infiltrating immune cells and
              pancreatic stellate cells gradually accumulated during tumor
              development. We defined several new Treg and exhausted T cell
              signature genes, including DUSP4, FANK1 and LAIR2. The analysis
              of TCGA datasets showed that patients with high expression of
              DUSP4 had significantly worse prognosis. In addition, we
              identified a new CAFs subset (complement-secreting CAFs, csCAFs),
              which specifically expresses complement system components, and
              constructed csCAFs-related module by weighted gene co-expression
              network analysis. The csCAFs were located in the tissue stroma
              adjacent to malignant ductal cells only in early PDAC.
              INTERPRETATION: We systematically explored PDAC heterogeneity and
              identified csCAFs as a new CAFs subset special to PDAC, which may
              be valuable for understanding the crosstalk inside tumor.

              characterization of the cellular composition of the tumor
              microenvironment is critical to the understanding of the disease
              and treatment of the patient. Single-cell transcriptomics has
              been used to study the cellular composition of different solid
              tumor types including PDAC. However, almost all of those studies
              used primary tumor tissues. METHODS: In this study, we employed a
              single-cell RNA sequencing technology to profile the
              transcriptomes of individual cells from dissociated primary
              tumors or metastatic biopsies obtained from patients with PDAC.
              Unsupervised clustering analysis as well as a new supervised
              classification algorithm, SuperCT, was used to identify the
              different cell types within the tumor tissues. The expression
              signatures of the different cell types were then compared between
              primary tumors and metastatic biopsies. The expressions of the
              cell type-specific signature genes were also correlated with
              patient survival using public datasets. RESULTS: Our single-cell
              RNA sequencing analysis revealed distinct cell types in primary
              and metastatic PDAC tissues including tumor cells, endothelial
              cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and immune cells.
              The cancer cells showed high inter-patient heterogeneity, whereas
              the stromal cells were more homogenous across patients. Immune
              infiltration varies significantly from patient to patient with
              majority of the immune cells being macrophages and exhausted
              lymphocytes. We found that the tumor cellular composition was an
              important factor in defining the PDAC subtypes. Furthermore, the
              expression levels of cell type-specific markers for EMT+ cancer
              cells, activated CAFs, and endothelial cells significantly
              associated with patient survival. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together,
              our work identifies significant heterogeneity in cellular
              compositions of PDAC tumors and between primary tumors and
              metastatic lesions. Furthermore, the cellular composition was an
              important factor in defining PDAC subtypes and significantly
              correlated with patient outcome. These findings provide valuable
              insights on the PDAC microenvironment and could potentially
              inform the management of PDAC patients.",

              Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are major players of
              desmoplastic stroma in PDAC, modulating tumor progression and
              therapeutic response. Using single-cell RNA sequencing, we
              explored the intertumoral heterogeneity among PDAC patients with
              different degrees of desmoplasia. We found substantial
              intertumoral heterogeneity in CAFs, ductal cancer cells, and
              immune cells between the extremely dense and loose types of PDACs
              (dense-type, high desmoplasia; loose-type, low desmoplasia).
              Notably, no difference in CAF abundance was detected, but a novel
              subtype of CAFs with a highly activated metabolic state (meCAFs)
              was found in loose-type PDAC compared to dense-type PDAC. MeCAFs
              had highly active glycolysis, whereas the corresponding cancer
              cells used oxidative phosphorylation as a major metabolic mode
              rather than glycolysis. We found that the proportion and activity
              of immune cells were much higher in loose-type PDAC than in
              dense-type PDAC. Then, the clinical significance of the CAF
              subtypes was further validated in our PDAC cohort and a public
              database. PDAC patients with abundant meCAFs had a higher risk of
              metastasis and a poor prognosis but showed a dramatically better
              response to immunotherapy (64.71\% objective response rate, one

              metabolic status between dense- and loose-type PDACs and
              identified meCAFs as a novel CAF subtype critical for PDAC

              tumors from `basal-like' tumors with more aggressive clinical
              behaviour. We derived PDAC organoids from primary tumors of 18
              patients, together with two matched samples from liver
              metastases. By single-cell RNA sequencing, we show that PDAC
              organoids consist of ductal cells with patient-specific

              cell surface proteins. We report `classical' and `basal-like'
              cells coexisting within single primary tumors or metastases, with
              greater intratumor subtype heterogeneity linked to higher tumor
              grade. Single-cell transcriptome analysis of PDAC organoids and
              primary PDAC identified distinct tumor cell states shared across
              patients, including a cycling progenitor cell state and a

  abstract = "To understand organ function, it is important to have an
              inventory of its cell types and of their corresponding marker
              genes. This is a particularly challenging task for human tissues
              like the pancreas, because reliable markers are limited. Hence,
              transcriptome-wide studies are typically done on pooled islets of
              Langerhans, obscuring contributions from rare cell types and of
              potential subpopulations. To overcome this challenge, we
              developed an automated platform that uses FACS, robotics, and the
              CEL-Seq2 protocol to obtain the transcriptomes of thousands of
              single pancreatic cells from deceased organ donors, allowing in
              silico purification of all main pancreatic cell types. We
              identify cell type-specific transcription factors and a
              subpopulation of REG3A-positive acinar cells. We also show that
              CD24 and TM4SF4 expression can be used to sort live alpha and
              beta cells with high purity. This resource will be useful for
              developing a deeper understanding of pancreatic biology and
              pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus.",
